## Introduction

This site contains several resources used for demonstrating Atelier B features and for showing its usage with practical applications, namely:
* models
* proof files (mathematical rules, proof tactics)
* C code generated (.h, .c, makefile)
* project archive (.arc)

Resources are sorted per video.
Files have been elaborated with [Atelier B 4.6+](https://www.atelierb.eu/en/download/) versions.
